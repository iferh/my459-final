# Identifying components of player experience in video games
The goal of the project was to apply quantitative text analysis techniques to analyse over 280,000 reviews written by videogame players to identify common components of player experience. Sentiment analysis was used to quantify reviewersâ€™ attitudes towards games in their comments, and topic modelling revealed themes in the collection of comments. The project identified seven aspects of game experience and analysed the association of different game genres with each theme.

The pre-processing and analysis was done in R.

## Data Source
The data used in the study was obtained from the Kaggle website as a publicly  available database that contains information collected from Metacritic.com
